/*
The Delta II is an optical harmonic tremolo with a deep feature set in a compact
form factor. A twist of the innovative LAG control allows you to smoothly morph
between traditional and harmonic tremolo, with infinite rhythmic possibilities.
Hazy throbbing rhythms, and energetic harmonics swirl and blend in a cauldron of
filtering, phasing pulsations.
VOICE Toggle - Each of the 3 voices consist of signal pairs to be modulated.
Switch Left - High & Dry. Switch Middle - High & Low. Switch Right - Low & Dry.
RATE - Wide range LFO speed control. Range is 0.12Hz - 60Hz(8s - 17ms).
DEPTH - Intensity of LFO modulation. At minimum, LFO modulation is disabled.
LAG - Dials in 0-180 degrees of phase lag between the LFO outputs. At minimum,
you’ll get traditional tremolo. As LAG is introduced, you’ll get harmonic
tremolo with tons of rhythmic variety.
FREQ - The frequency splitter is a resonant 2-pole state-variable filter.
High-pass, and Low-pass outputs are paired in different VOICE combinations for
modulation. Range is 100Hz - 6kHz.
RES - Introduces a formant vocal quality to the filter. At higher settings,
you’ll notice a more dramatic emphasis as you sweep filter frequency.
EXP Jack - Sweep the RATE or DEPTH directly using any standard expression
pedal or 0-5V CV via ¼” TRS cable. An internal switch selects which
parameter is routed to the EXP Jack.
BYPASS Footswitch - True-bypass soft-touch relay switching to engage and
disengage the effect.
ALTERNATE MODES - Apply power with the footswitch depressed. The LAG control
transforms into a 4 position mode selector with additional LFO presets.
Mode 1 - LFO output 1 runs at normal speed, and LFO output 2 at half speed.
Mode 2 - Same as mode 1, but offbeat from each other.
Mode 3 - LFO output 2 runs at normal speed, and LFO output 1 at half speed.
Mode 4 - Same as mode 3, but offbeat from each other.
The Delta II requires external power of 9-18V DC, negative center via the 2.1mm
jack next to the output jack. The Delta II has a high 1M ohm input impedance and a
maximum current draw of 45mA when the effect is engaged. Please contact Spaceman
if you are unsure about your DC adapter.
